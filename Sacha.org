#+TITLE: Sacha Chua's Emacs configuration
#+OPTIONS: toc:4 h:4


* Configuration
** About this file
<<babel-init>>

Inspired by the [[http://eschulte.me/emacs24-starter-kit/#installation][Emacs Starter Kit]], I set up my configuration file
using Org-babel. Because my username is Sacha, I can save this as
Sacha.org in my =~/.emacs.d= directory to have it automatically load.
You could load it with =(org-babel-load-file "/path/to/file")=,
changing the path appropriately, but you'll probably want to tweak it
extensively first. 

This page: [[http://sachac.github.io/.emacs.d/Sacha.html][HTML]] - [[https://github.com/sachac/.emacs.d/blob/gh-pages/Sacha.org][Org]] - [[https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3968124/sacha-emacs.el][.el]] - [[http://sachac.github.io/.emacs.d/][Github]] - also, http://sach.ac/dotemacs

To be precise, this is what's in my init.el:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp  :tangle no
;; This sets up the load path so that we can override it
(package-initialize nil)
;; Override the packages with the git version of Org and other packages
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/org-mode/lisp")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/org-mode/contrib/lisp")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/code/beeminder.el")
;; Load the rest of the packages
(package-initialize t)
(require 'org)
(require 'ob-tangle)
(org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/Sacha.org"))
#+end_src

If you're new to Emacs Lisp, you probably don't want to copy and paste
large chunks of this code. Instead, copy small parts of it (always
making sure to copy a complete set of parentheses) into your
=*scratch*= buffer or some other buffer in =emacs-lisp-mode=. Use =M-x
eval-buffer= to evaluate the code and see if you like the way that
Emacs behaves. See [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eintr.html][An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp]] for more details on Emacs Lisp. You can also find the manual by using =C-h i= (=info=) and choosing "Emacs Lisp Intro".

I've installed a lot of packages. See the [[*Add%20package%20sources][package sources]] section to
add the repositories to your configuration. When you see =use-package=
and a package name you might like, you can use =M-x package-install=
to install the package of that name. Note that use-package is itself
provided by a package, so you'll probably want to install that and
=bind-key=.

If you're viewing the Org file, you can open source code blocks (those are the ones in begin_src) in a separate buffer by moving your point inside them and typing C-c ' (=org-edit-special=). This opens another buffer in =emacs-lisp-mode=, so you can use =M-x eval-buffer= to load the changes. If you want to explore how functions work, use =M-x edebug-defun= to set up debugging for that function, and then call it. You can learn more about edebug in the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Edebug.html][Emacs Lisp]] manual.

I like using =(setq ...)= more than Customize because I can neatly organize my configuration that way. 

** Personal information

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq user-full-name "Sacha Chua"
        user-mail-address "sacha@sachachua.com")
#+end_src

** Emacs initialization
*** Add my elisp directory and other files

Sometimes I load files outside the package system. As long as they're
in a directory in my =load-path=, Emacs can find them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp/artbollocks-mode")
(require 'use-package)
#+end_src

*** Load secrets

I keep slightly more sensitive information in a separate file so that I can easily publish my main configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load-file "~/.emacs.secrets")
#+end_src

*** Add package sources

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
#+end_src

Use =M-x package-refresh-contents= to reload the list of packages
after adding these for the first time.

*** Byte-compile my init files to speed things up next time

I hardly ever use this because I don't care about my Emacs startup
speed. The trick to using Emacs is to not close it. I start Emacs when
my computer boots up. I suspend my computer when I go to sleep. Pretty
much the only time I shut down is when I need to update the system.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun sacha/byte-recompile ()
  (interactive)
  (byte-recompile-directory "~/.emacs.d" 0)
  (byte-recompile-directory "~/elisp" 0))
#+end_src

*** Install packages if necessary

ELPA makes it easy to install packages without tracking down all the
different websites. Let's define a function that makes it easy to
install packages. I don't actually use this a lot any more, but it can
be handy.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun sacha/package-install (package &optional repository)
  "Install PACKAGE if it has not yet been installed.
If REPOSITORY is specified, use that."
  (unless (package-installed-p package)
    (let ((package-archives (if repository
                                (list (assoc repository package-archives))
                              package-archives)))
    (package-install package))))
#+end_src

** General configuration
*** Backups

This is one of the things people usually want to change right away. By default, Emacs saves backup files in the current directory. These are the files ending in =~= that are cluttering up your directory lists. The following code stashes them all in =~/.emacs.d/backups=, where I can find them with =C-x C-f= (=find-file=) if I really need to.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq backup-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.emacs.d/backups")))
#+end_src

Disk space is cheap. Save lots.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq delete-old-versions -1)
(setq version-control t)
(setq auto-save-file-name-transforms '((".*" "~/.emacs.d/auto-save-list" t)))
#+end_src


*** History

From http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/C3F.html
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq savehist-file "~/.emacs.d/savehist")
(savehist-mode 1)
(setq savehist-save-minibuffer-history 1)
(setq savehist-additional-variables
      '(kill-ring
        search-ring
        regexp-search-ring))
#+end_src

When you're starting out, tooltips, menus, and the tool bar can be very helpful. [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/03/emacs-basics-using-mouse/][(Emacs Basics: Using the Mouse]]). Eventually, you may want to reclaim that extra little bit of screenspace. The following code turns those things off when using a graphical Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when window-system
  (tooltip-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (menu-bar-mode -1))
#+end_src
*** Winner mode - undo and redo window configuration

=winner-mode= lets you use =C-c <left>= and =C-c <right>= to switch between window configurations. This is handy when something has popped up a buffer that you want to look at briefly before returning to whatever you were working on. When you're done, press =C-c <left>=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package winner
    :config (winner-mode 1))
#+end_src
*** Sentences end with a single space

In my world, sentences end with a single space. This makes
sentence navigation commands work for me.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq sentence-end-double-space nil)
#+end_src

*** Helm - interactive completion

Helm makes it easy to complete various things. I find it to be easier
to configure than ido in order to get completion in as many places as
possible, although I prefer ido's way of switching buffers.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package helm
      :init
      (progn 
        (require 'helm-config) 
        (setq helm-candidate-number-limit 10)
        ;; From https://gist.github.com/antifuchs/9238468
        (setq helm-idle-delay 0.0 ; update fast sources immediately (doesn't).
              helm-input-idle-delay 0.01  ; this actually updates things
                                            ; reeeelatively quickly.
              helm-quick-update t
              helm-M-x-requires-pattern nil
              helm-ff-skip-boring-files t)
        (helm-mode))
      :config
      (progn
        ;; I don't like the way switch-to-buffer uses history, since
        ;; that confuses me when it comes to buffers I've already
        ;; killed. Let's use ido instead.
        (add-to-list 'helm-completing-read-handlers-alist '(switch-to-buffer . ido)))
      :bind (("C-c h" . helm-mini)))
    (ido-mode -1) ;; Turn off ido mode in case I enabled it accidentally
#+end_src


*** Change "yes or no" to "y or n"

Lazy people like me never want to type "yes" when "y" will suffice.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)   
#+end_src

*** Minibuffer editing - more space!

    Sometimes you want to be able to do fancy things with the text
    that you're entering into the minibuffer. Sometimes you just want
    to be able to read it, especially when it comes to lots of text.
    This binds =C-M-e= in a minibuffer) so that you can edit the
    contents of the minibuffer before submitting it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package miniedit
    :commands minibuffer-edit
    :init (miniedit-install))
#+end_src

*** Set up a light-on-dark color scheme

I like light on dark because I find it to be more restful. The
color-theme in ELPA was a little odd, though, so we define some advice to make
it work. Some things still aren't quite right.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defadvice color-theme-alist (around sacha activate)
    (if (ad-get-arg 0)
        ad-do-it
      nil))
  (sacha/package-install 'color-theme)
  (defun sacha/setup-color-theme ()
    (interactive)
    (color-theme-solarized 'dark)
    (set-face-foreground 'secondary-selection "darkblue")
    (set-face-background 'secondary-selection "lightblue")
    (set-face-background 'font-lock-doc-face "black")
    (set-face-foreground 'font-lock-doc-face "wheat")
    (set-face-background 'font-lock-string-face "black")
    (set-face-foreground 'org-todo "green")
    (set-face-background 'org-todo "black"))

  (use-package color-theme
    :init
    (sacha/setup-color-theme))
#+end_src

I sometimes need to switch to a lighter background for screenshots.
For that, I use =color-theme-vim=.

Some more tweaks to solarized:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-faces
   '(erc-input-face ((t (:foreground "antique white"))))
   '(helm-selection ((t (:background "ForestGreen" :foreground "black"))))
   '(org-agenda-clocking ((t (:inherit secondary-selection :foreground "black"))) t)
   '(org-agenda-done ((t (:foreground "dim gray" :strike-through nil))))
   '(org-done ((t (:foreground "PaleGreen" :weight normal :strike-through t))))
   '(org-clock-overlay ((t (:background "SkyBlue4" :foreground "black"))))
   '(org-headline-done ((((class color) (min-colors 16) (background dark)) (:foreground "LightSalmon" :strike-through t))))
   '(outline-1 ((t (:inherit font-lock-function-name-face :foreground "cornflower blue")))))
#+end_src

*** Undo tree mode - visualize your undos and branches

People often struggle with the Emacs undo model, where there's really no concept of "redo" - you simply undo the undo. 
# 
This lets you use =C-x u= (=undo-tree-visualize=) to visually walk through the changes you've made, undo back to a certain point (or redo), and go down different branches.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package undo-tree
    :init (global-undo-tree-mode))
#+end_src

*** Help - guide-key

It's hard to remember keyboard shortcuts. The =guide-key= package pops up help after a short delay.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package guide-key
  :init
  (setq guide-key/guide-key-sequence '("C-x r" "C-x 4" "C-c"))
  (guide-key-mode 1))  ; Enable guide-key-mode
#+end_src

*** UTF-8

From http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/C3F.html
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
(when (display-graphic-p)
  (setq x-select-request-type '(UTF8_STRING COMPOUND_TEXT TEXT STRING)))
#+end_src

** Navigation
*** Pop to mark

Handy way of getting back to previous places.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(bind-key "C-x p" 'pop-to-mark-command)
#+end_src
*** Text size

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(bind-key "C-+" 'text-scale-increase)
(bind-key "C--" 'text-scale-decrease)
#+end_src

*** Helm-swoop - quickly finding lines

This promises to be a fast way to find things. Let's bind it to =Ctrl-Shift-S= to see if I can get used to that...

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package helm-swoop
 :bind (("C-S-s" . helm-swoop)))
#+end_src

*** Windmove - switching between windows

Windmove lets you move between windows with something more natural than cycling through =C-x o= (=other-window=).
Windmove doesn't behave well with Org, so we need to use different keybindings.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package windmove
    :bind
    (("<f2> <right>" . windmove-right)
     ("<f2> <left>" . windmove-left)
     ("<f2> <up>" . windmove-up)
     ("<f2> <down>" . windmove-down)))
#+end_src

*** Searching based on the current word

This lets me search up and down. I don't use this often, though.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun sacha/search-word-backward ()
    "Find the previous occurrence of the current word."
    (interactive)
    (let ((cur (point)))
      (skip-syntax-backward "w_")
      (goto-char
       (if (re-search-backward (concat "\\_<" (current-word) "\\_>") nil t)
           (match-beginning 0)
         cur))))
  
  (defun sacha/search-word-forward ()
    "Find the next occurrence of the current word."
    (interactive)
    (let ((cur (point)))
      (skip-syntax-forward "w_")
      (goto-char
       (if (re-search-forward (concat "\\_<" (current-word) "\\_>") nil t)
           (match-beginning 0)
         cur))))
  (defadvice search-for-keyword (around sacha activate)
    "Match in a case-insensitive way."
    (let ((case-fold-search t))
      ad-do-it))
  (global-set-key '[M-up] 'sacha/search-word-backward)
  (global-set-key '[M-down] 'sacha/search-word-forward)
#+end_src

*** Frequently-accessed files
Registers allow you to jump to a file or other location quickly. To
jump to a register, use =C-x r j= followed by the letter of the
register.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (dolist
      (r `((?i (file . "~/.emacs.d/Sacha.org"))
           (?o (file . "~/personal/organizer.org"))
           (?b (file . "~/personal/business.org"))
           (?w (file . "~/Dropbox/public/sharing/index.org"))
           (?W (file . "~/Dropbox/public/blog.org"))
           (?g (file . "~/sachac.github.io/evil-plans/index.org"))
           ))
    (set-register (car r) (cadr r)))
#+end_src

*** Browse-kill-ring - see what you've cut so that you can paste it   :drill:

Make sense of the kill ring! This lets you list the contents of the
kill ring and paste a specific item. You can also manipulate your kill
ring contents.

If you're new to Emacs, you might not yet know about what the kill
ring is. It stores the items that you cut (or kill, in Emacs terms).
You're not limited to pasting just the most recent item - you can
paste the second-to-the-last item you cut, and so on. I remember to
use =C-y= and =M-y= when going backwards in the kill ring, but I never
quite remember how to go forward, so browse-kill-ring makes it easier.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (sacha/package-install 'browse-kill-ring)

*** Key chords 
I'm on a Dvorak keyboard, so these might not work for you.
Experimenting with this. =key-chord= lets you define keyboard

Also, =visual-line-mode= is so much better than =auto-fill-mode=. It doesn't actually break the text into multiple lines - it only looks that way.

I use [[http://www.orgmode.org][Org Mode]] to take notes, publish my blog, and do all sorts of
stuff.

*** My files

Here are the Org files I use. I should probably organize them better. =)

*** Modules
Org has a whole bunch of optional modules. These are the ones I'm
currently experimenting with.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-modules '(org-bbdb 
                      org-gnus

           (bind-key "C-c R" 'org-reveal org-mode-map)))
#+end_src

=append-next-kill= is more useful to me than =org-table-copy-region=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (eval-after-load 'org
    '(progn
       (bind-key "C-M-w" 'append-next-kill org-mode-map)))
#+end_src

I don't use the diary, but I do use the clock a lot.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-agenda
    :init (bind-key "i" 'org-agenda-clock-in org-agenda-mode-map))
#+end_src
    
*** Navigation

From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15011703/is-there-an-emacs-org-mode-command-to-jump-to-an-org-heading
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-goto-interface 'outline
        org-goto-max-level 10)
  (require 'imenu)
  (bind-key "M-o" 'imenu)
  (bind-key "C-c j" 'org-clock-goto) ;; jump to current task from anywhere
  (setq org-cycle-include-plain-lists 'integrate)
#+end_src

*** Link Org subtrees and navigate between them
The following code makes it easier for me to link trees with entries, as in http://sachachua.com/evil-plans

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun sacha/org-follow-entry-link ()
  "Follow the defined link for this entry."
  (interactive)
  (if (org-entry-get (point) "LINK")
      (org-open-link-from-string (org-entry-get (point) "LINK"))
    (org-open-at-point)))

(bind-key "C-c o" 'sacha/org-follow-entry-link org-mode-map)

(defun sacha/org-link-projects (location)
  "Add link properties between the current subtree and the one specified by LOCATION."
  (interactive
   (list (let ((org-refile-use-cache nil))
     (org-refile-get-location "Location"))))
  (let ((link1 (org-store-link nil)) link2)
    (save-window-excursion
      (org-refile 4 nil location)
      (setq link2 (org-store-link nil))
      (org-set-property "LINK" link1))
    (org-set-property "LINK" link2)))
#+end_src

*** Taking notes

    My org files are in my =personal= directory, which is actually a
    symlink to a directory in my Dropbox. That way, I can update my
    Org files from multiple computers.
    
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-directory "~/personal")
  (setq org-default-notes-file "~/personal/organizer.org")
#+end_src

This makes it easier to add links from outside.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun sacha/yank-more ()
  (interactive)
  (insert "[[")
  (yank)
  (insert "][more]]"))
(global-set-key (kbd "<f6>") 'sacha/yank-more)
#+end_src

**** Templates

     I use =org-capture= templates to quickly jot down tasks, ledger
     entries, notes, and other semi-structured pieces of information.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src
***** Allow refiling in the middle(ish) of a capture

This lets me use =C-c C-r= to refile a capture and then jump to the
new location. I wanted to be able to file tasks under projects so that
they could inherit the QUANTIFIED property that I use to track time
(and any Beeminder-related properties too), but I also wanted to be
able to clock in on them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun sacha/org-capture-refile-and-jump ()
    (interactive)
    (org-capture-refile)
    (org-refile-goto-last-stored))
  (require 'org-capture)
  (bind-key "C-c C-r" 'sacha/org-capture-refile-and-jump org-capture-mode-map)
#+end_src

**** Refiling

=org-refile= lets you organize notes by typing in the headline to file them under.

              ("~/personal/outline.org" . (:maxlevel . 3))
              ("~/personal/routines.org" . (:maxlevel . 4))))
      (setq org-blank-before-new-entry nil)
    #+end_src
    
**** Estimating WPM

     I'm curious about how fast I type some things.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-clock)
(defun sacha/org-entry-wpm ()
  (interactive)
  (save-restriction

	(message "WPM: %d (words: %d, minutes: %d)" wpm words minutes)
	(kill-new (number-to-string wpm))))))
#+end_src

*** Managing tasks
**** Track TODO state
<<todo-keywords>>

The parentheses indicate keyboard shortcuts that I can use to set the task state. @ and ! toggle logging.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
       (setq org-todo-keywords
        '((sequence
           "TODO(t)"  ; next action
           "TOBLOG(b)"  ; next action
           "STARTED(s)"
           "WAITING(w@/!)"
           "SOMEDAY(.)" "|" "DONE(x!)" "CANCELLED(c@)")
          (sequence "TODELEGATE(-)" "DELEGATED(d)" "COMPLETE(x)")))
#+end_src
     
**** Projects

Projects are headings with the =:PROJECT:= tag, so we don't want that tag inherited.

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
       (setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance '("PROJECT"))
     #+end_src

**** Tag tasks with GTD-ish contexts

This defines keyboard shortcuts for those, too.

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
              (setq org-tag-alist '(("@work" . ?b) 
                                    ("@home" . ?h) 
                                    ("@writing" . ?w)
                                    ("@errands" . ?e)

                                    ("lowenergy" . ?0)
                                    ("highenergy" . ?1)))
     #+end_src
**** Enable filtering by effort estimates

That way, it's easy to see short tasks that I can finish.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-global-properties
        '("Effort_ALL". "0:05 0:15 0:30 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00"))
#+end_src
     
**** Track time

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-clock-idle-time nil)

        (cond
         ((derived-mode-p 'org-agenda-mode)
          (let* ((marker (or (org-get-at-bol 'org-marker)

         (t (if (org-get-todo-state)
                    (org-todo "STARTED")))))))
#+end_src
     
Too many clock entries clutter up a heading.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-log-into-drawer "LOGBOOK")
(setq org-clock-into-drawer 1)
#+end_src

**** Habits

     I like using org-habits to track consistency. My task names tend
     to be a bit long, though, so I've configured the graph column to
     show a little bit more to the right.
     
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-habit-graph-column 80)
(setq org-habit-show-habits-only-for-today nil)
#+end_src

If you want to use habits, be sure to schedule your tasks and add a STYLE property with the value of =habit= to the tasks you want displayed.

*** Estimating tasks

From "Add an effort estimate on the fly when clocking in" on the
[[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-hacks.html][Org Hacks]] page:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Modifying org agenda so that I can display a subset of tasks

I want to create an agenda command that displays a list of tasks by
context. That way, I can quickly preview a bunch of contexts and
decide what I feel like doing the most.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar sacha/org-agenda-limit-items nil "Number of items to show in agenda to-do views; nil if unlimited.")

*** Flexible scheduling of tasks

I (theoretically) want to be able to schedule tasks for dates like the first Saturday
of every month. Fortunately, [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13555385/org-mode-how-to-schedule-repeating-tasks-for-the-first-saturday-of-every-month][someone else has figured that out!]]

*** Org agenda
**** Basic configuration
I have quite a few Org files, but I keep my agenda items and TODOs in
only a few of them them for faster scanning.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq org-agenda-files '("~/personal/organizer.org"
                             "~/personal/people.org"
                             "~/personal/business.org"
                             "~/personal/routines.org"
                             "~/dropbox/public/learning.org"))
#+end_src

I like looking at two days at a time when I plan using the Org
agenda. I want to see my log entries, but I don't want to see
scheduled items that I've finished. I like seeing a time grid so that
I can get a sense of how appointments are spread out.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-agenda-span 2)
  (setq org-agenda-sticky nil)
  (setq org-agenda-show-log t)
  (setq org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t)
  (setq org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t)
  (setq org-agenda-time-grid
        '((daily today require-timed)
         "----------------"
         (800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800)))
  (setq org-columns-default-format "%50ITEM %12SCHEDULED %TODO %3PRIORITY %Effort{:} %TAGS")
#+end_src

Some other keyboard shortcuts:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(bind-key "Y" 'org-agenda-todo-yesterday org-agenda-mode-map)
#+end_src

# <<project_subtasks>>
**** Starting my weeks on Saturday

I like looking at weekends as [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2010/11/week-beginnings/][week beginnings]] instead, so I want the
Org agenda to start on Saturdays.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-start-on-weekday 6)
#+end_src

**** Display projects with associated subtasks

I wanted a view that showed projects with a few subtasks underneath
them. Here's a sample of the output:

#+begin_example
Headlines with TAGS match: +PROJECT
Press `C-u r' to search again with new search string
  organizer:  Set up communication processes for Awesome Foundation Toronto
  organizer:  TODO Announce the next pitch night
  organizer:  TODO Follow up with the winner of the previous pitch night for any news to include in the updates

  organizer:  Tidy up the house so that I can find things quickly
  organizer:  TODO Inventory all the things in closets and boxes         :@home:
  organizer:  TODO Drop things off for donation                       :@errands:

**** Org agenda custom commands

There are quite a few custom commands here, and I often forget to use
them. =) But it's good to define them, and over time, I'll get the
hang of using these more!

| Key         | Description                                                                                    |

| T           | Not really an agenda command - shows the to-do tree in the current file                        |

| 0           | Show common contexts with up to 3 tasks each, so that I can choose what I feel like working on |
| ) (shift-0) | Show common contexts with all the tasks associated with them                                   |

*** Monthly reviews

<<monthly-reviews>>

I want to be able to see what I worked on in a month so that I can write my [[http://sachachua.com/blog/category/monthly][monthly reviews]]. This code makes it easy to display a month's clocked tasks and time. I haven't been particularly thorough in tracking time before, but now that I have a shortcut that logs in Quantified Awesome as well as in Org, I should end up clocking more.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun sacha/org-review-month (start-date)
    "Review the month's clocked tasks and time."
    (interactive (list (org-read-date)))
    ;; Set to the beginning of the month
    (setq start-date (concat (substring start-date 0 8) "01"))
    (let ((org-agenda-show-log t)
          (org-agenda-start-with-log-mode t)
          (org-agenda-start-with-clockreport-mode t)
          (org-agenda-clockreport-parameter-plist '(:link t :maxlevel 3)))
      (org-agenda-list nil start-date 'month)))

*** Viewing, navigating, and editing the Org tree

    I often cut and paste subtrees. This makes it easier to cut
    something and paste it elsewhere in the hierarchy.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Fix timestamps in Flickr links

Photosync (for syncing with Flickr) can't deal with periods in filenames. Org gets confused with dashes in timestamps that are in link text. Solution? Save files with dashes, then use a little code to replace dashes in the region.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun sacha/fix-flickr-list (beg end)

*** Publishing
Timestamps and section numbers make my published files look more
complicated than they are. Let's turn them off by default.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-with-section-numbers nil)
(setq org-html-include-timestamps nil)
#+end_src

This makes it easier to publish my public Dropbox files:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'org-publish)
    (setq org-publish-project-alist
          '(("public"
             :base-directory "c:/sacha/Dropbox/public"

**** Org2blog

I use org2blog to post to my blog, which is Wordpress-based. I used to
use punchagan's org2blog, but there's a completely different one in
ELPA, so I figured I'd give that a try.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(sacha/package-install 'org2blog)
(require 'org2blog-autoloads)
(setq org-export-with-toc nil)
(setq org-export-htmlize-output-type 'css)

**** Publish without prompting

I want to be able to export without having to say yes to code blocks all the time.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun sacha/org-html-export-trustingly ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil))
    (org-html-export-to-html)))

  (let ((org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil))
    (org-html-publish-to-html plist filename pub-dir)))
#+end_src
**** Stylesheet / header
Might as well take advantage of my stylesheet:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-html-head "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"http://sachachua.com/blog/wp-content/themes/sacha-v3/foundation/css/foundation.min.css\"></link>

(setq org-html-htmlize-output-type 'css)
(setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
#+end_src
**** Footer

Make it easy to scroll to the top:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-html-preamble "<a name=\"top\" id=\"top\"></a>")
(setq org-html-postamble "
<style type=\"text/css\">
.back-to-top {
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 2em;
    right: 0px;
    text-decoration: none;
    color: #000000;
    background-color: rgba(235, 235, 235, 0.80);
    font-size: 12px;
    padding: 1em;
    display: none;
}

.back-to-top:hover {    
    background-color: rgba(135, 135, 135, 0.50);
}
</style>

<a class=\"back-to-top\" href=\"#top\">Back to top</a>

<script type=\"text/javascript\">
    var offset = 220;
    var duration = 500;
    jQuery(window).scroll(function() {
        if (jQuery(this).scrollTop() > offset) {
            jQuery('.back-to-top').fadeIn(duration);
        } else {
            jQuery('.back-to-top').fadeOut(duration);
        }
    });
</script>")
#+end_src

**** Copy region
Sometimes I want a region's HTML in my kill-ring/clipboard without any of the extra fluff:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun sacha/org-copy-region-as-html (beg end &optional level)
    "Make it easier to copy code for Wordpress posts and other things."
    (interactive "r\np")

          (org-html-toplevel-hlevel (or level 3)))
      (kill-new
       (org-export-string-as (buffer-substring beg end) 'html t))))
#+end_src

Sometimes I want a subtree:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun sacha/org-copy-subtree-as-html ()
  (interactive)
  (sacha/org-copy-region-as-html
   (org-back-to-heading)
   (org-end-of-subtree)))
#+end_src
**** UTF-8 checkboxes

This snippet turns =- [X]= into ☑ and =- [ ]= into ☐, but leaves =[-]= alone. 
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-html-checkbox-types 'unicode)
(setq org-html-checkbox-types
 '((unicode (on . "<span class=\"task-done\">&#x2611;</span>") 
            (off . "<span class=\"task-todo\">&#x2610;</span>") 
            (trans . "<span class=\"task-in-progress\">[-]</span>"))))
#+end_src

*** Structure templates

Org makes it easy to insert blocks by typing =<s[TAB]=, etc.
I hardly ever use LaTeX, but I insert a lot of Emacs Lisp blocks, so I
redefine =<l= to insert a Lisp block instead.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-structure-template-alist 
        '(("s" "#+begin_src ?\n\n#+end_src" "<src lang=\"?\">\n\n</src>")

          ("v" "#+BEGIN_VERSE\n?\n#+END_VERSE" "<verse>\n?\n</verse>")
          ("c" "#+BEGIN_COMMENT\n?\n#+END_COMMENT")
          ("l" "#+begin_src emacs-lisp\n?\n#+end_src" "<src lang=\"emacs-lisp\">\n?\n</src>")
          ("L" "#+latex: " "<literal style=\"latex\">?</literal>")
          ("h" "#+begin_html\n?\n#+end_html" "<literal style=\"html\">\n?\n</literal>")
          ("H" "#+html: " "<literal style=\"html\">?</literal>")
          ("a" "#+begin_ascii\n?\n#+end_ascii")
          ("A" "#+ascii: ")
          ("i" "#+index: ?" "#+index: ?")
          ("I" "#+include %file ?" "<include file=%file markup=\"?\">")))

*** Attachments

Org lets you attach files to an Org file. Haven't gotten the hang of this yet, but looks interesting.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** Counting

Good way to remind myself that I have lots of STARTED tasks.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (interactive)

#+end_src
*** Diagrams and graphics

#+end_src
*** Share my Emacs configuration

This code gets around the fact that my config is called Sacha.org, but
I want it to export as sacha-emacs.org in my Dropbox's public
directory. Although now that I'm shifting to Github Pages, maybe I
don't need this any more...

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun sacha/org-share-emacs ()

*** Adapt to being on Windows

I'm on Windows, so I use Cygwin to add Unix-y tools to make my life easier.

*** Expand region

This is something I have to get the hang of too. It gradually expands the selection. Handy for Emacs Lisp.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (sacha/package-install 'expand-region)
  (use-package expand-region
    :bind ("C-=" . er/expand-region))
#+end_src
*** Emacs Lisp
**** Edebug

Did you know edebug has a trace function? I didn't. Thanks, agumonkey!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq edebug-trace t)
#+end_src

While edebugging, use T to view a trace buffer (=*edebug-trace*=).
Emacs will quickly execute the rest of your code, printing out the
arguments and return values for each expression it evaluates.

**** Eldoc
Eldoc provides minibuffer hints when working with Emacs Lisp.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Enable minibuffer completion
[2013-03-31] Superseded by ido-hacks?

It can be difficult to remember the full names of Emacs commands, so I
use =icomplete-mode= for minibuffer completion. This also makes it
easier to discover commands.
